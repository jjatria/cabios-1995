Description: A multivariate analysis method called co-inertia analysis was
    used to determine the main relationships between two data tables having
    identical rows. This method is available in the ADE multivariate analysis
    package for Macintosh micro-computers. It was applied to two data sets,
    one containing the amino-acid composition of 999 E. coli proteins, and the
    other the values of 402 physico-chemical properties for the 20 natural
    amino-acids. There were strong relationships between amino-acid
    physico-chemical properties and the composition of proteins. The first
    common factor was hydrophobicity; it is linked to the biological
    environment of proteins, either in the cytoplasm (or outside the cell),
    or in the nonpolar environment of the phospholipid bilayer of biological
    membranes. The second factor linked the expressivity of protein genes and
    the propensity of amino-acids to form alpha helix/beta sheets. The third
    factor showed that heavy, aromatic amino-acids tend to be avoided, except
    when they are needed for structural or functional reasons. These results
    are discussed in terms of selective pressure acting on amino-acid
    composition of proteins.
