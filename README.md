Acknowledgements: We thank D. Chessel and C. Gautier for helpful comments on
a first draft of the published manuscript. We thank Daniel Chessel for
pointing out on june 2004 that the dataset published originally on the web
(14-DEC-1994 at ftp://biom3.univ-lyon1.fr/pub/datasets/CABIOS95) didn't
allowed for the reproduction of the results of the paper because of a wrong
column order in one table (this point has been fixed now, see details). We
thank Daniel Chessel for improving the algorithm for co-inertia: in the
original paper it was stated that: "Improvements in the algorithm should
provide computation times for co-inertia analysis comparable to those for
PCA and CA: the matrix from which eigenvalues and eigenvectors are computed
will be of dimension min(n, p, q), with n = number of observations,
p = number of variables in the first table, q = number of variables in the
second table (instead of min(p, q) as is now the case)." This is no more the
case, just to give a striking benchmark our original work involved computation
times that were in hours for now in seconds. Moore's law for a 10 year lag is
no sufficient to explain this. Thanks Daniel (see more on this in french
there).

Abstract: A multivariate analysis method called co-inertia analysis was
used to determine the main relationships between two data tables having
identical rows. This method is available in the ADE multivariate analysis
package for Macintosh micro-computers. It was applied to two data sets, one
containing the amino-acid composition of 999 E. coli proteins, and the other
the values of 402 physico-chemical properties for the 20 natural amino-acids.
There were strong relationships between amino-acid physico-chemical
properties and the composition of proteins. The first common factor was
hydrophobicity; it is linked to the biological environment of proteins,
either in the cytoplasm (or outside the cell), or in the nonpolar environment
of the phospholipid bilayer of biological membranes. The second factor linked
the expressivity of protein genes and the propensity of amino-acids to form
alpha helix/beta sheets. The third factor showed that heavy, aromatic
amino-acids tend to be avoided, except when they are needed for structural or
functional reasons. These results are discussed in terms of selective
pressure acting on amino-acid composition of proteins.

Note: This web page wasn't created at the same time as the original paper
submission in 1994, it's more a re-creation, produced more than 10 years
later (in july 2006), than a pure reproducibility claim. Anyway, data and
methods are here under the GPL, you can play with both. Share and enjoy!
